# Pranker
![A beautiful candid of Patrick Star should have been here :'(](patrick.jpg "IS THIS THE KRUSTY KRAB?")

## Inspiration
Just felt like doing something quick with Twilio + Really like pranking people = Pranker!
## What it does
You text a target number to the service, and it prank calls the target. Nuff said
## How I built it
I used Python Flask for the backend and the Python Twilio REST Client for the Twilio stuff 
## Challenges I ran into
Ehh, actually more of a challenge was just running a public facing web server. Apparently my version of ngrok had sunsetted :/. So had to spend some time figuring that out
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Well, I had a couple of small projects I wanted to do this time. So 1 down, 2 more to go :)
## What I learned
Honestly, I learned that no matter how quick you think a hack will be, it always ends up taking a couple of hours to get working the way you want.
## What's next for Pranker
How about building an ML agent on the backend that tailors the responses to the target's frustration, MWAHAHA
